With Vercel, you can deploy Serverless Functions, which are pieces of code written with backend languages (Node.js, Go, Python, Ruby) that take an HTTP request and provide a response.

You can use Serverless Functions to handle user authentication, form submission, database queries, custom slack commands, and more.
